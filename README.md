## Usage

To play the game, simply click on one of the three buttons - Rock, Paper, or Scissors. Your selection will be displayed on the interface, and the computer's choice will be randomly generated. The outcome of the round will be displayed, and the scores will be updated accordingly.

The game continues until either the player or the computer reaches a score of 5. When the game is over, a screen will display the winner, and you can choose to play again by clicking the "PLAY AGAIN!" button.
